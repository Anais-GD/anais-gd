## Hi there 👋
My name is Anaïs-Galvañ.\
I have a PhD in plant pathology 🌱 and right now, I am training in remote sensing (🛰️🌎🌿).\
My interest is in applying remote sensing to detect and make decisions regarding agricultural pests and diseases.\
I want to use this space to develop my projects and create my blog.\
Stay tuned!
